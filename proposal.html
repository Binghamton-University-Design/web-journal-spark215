					<br><br>The concept of my project is a personal memoir.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					As a senior who is wrapping up a chapter of her life, I have been reflecting a lot. The experiences I’ve had, the person I have grown into, the person I am becoming are all things I have been thinking about recently. These thoughts, I believe, are things unique to this period. The thoughts I have reminiscing about my college career at this point in my life will be different from the perspective of me reminiscing from the future. In addition, after doing a lot of projects that had a specific goal and a specific process, I wanted to do something with a little more freedom, creativity, and perhaps a little more chaos. I’m approaching this project more like a letter to myself. Although the logistics and the overall flow of the “story” is not yet clear, I know I will enjoy the process of reflection and creation.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					I want to think about the highs and lows of my life. Like my mind, at this point in time the specifics of the project is jumbled but I think sorting through my experiences in the form of a visual work will help me organize my own thoughts. One thing in particular I want to pay attention to is my mental state at these various points in my life. I am not clinically diagnosed with anything. Rather, I have never even been to a therapist. However, I believe mental struggles, periods of gloom and depression, episodes of anxiety are things everyone goes through. You don’t always have to be formally diagnosed to know when you are struggling. I want to leave this project as a reminder for myself that even when the going gets tough, it’s not the end of the world. I am not the only one going through these issues and they are not what should dictate my life. I have gotten through tough times before; I can do it again. 
				</h2>
				<h2>
					As someone who loves creating visual art, whether it be sketching, drawing, or painting, I want to use these elements I am comfortable with to leave myself a diary, or a letter to myself in a way. There are certain visual elements I have already thought of. My happiest memories will be filled with warm and vibrant colors. I want to create a mood of being blinded by the warmth and joy. My depressive states will be in black and white. Moments of my anxiety will be in dizzying neon colors against black backgrounds. Color schemes and visual aesthetic vary from different experiences.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					I have some scenes in my life I would like to bring to my project. One specific one is my immigration to the US. A specific scene I remember in my past is me, a five-year-old, not understanding the meaning of immigrating. In Korea, I had lived with my immediate family and my paternal grandmother. At the airport, when we were getting ready to board, I remember my grandmother crying. The strong, intimidating, sometimes scary woman was crying. I didn’t understand. I remember hugging her and telling her, “Why are you crying? We’ll be back soon”. Little did I know, we were moving forever. I think the best way to convey this scene is to color everything in bright warm colors. I remember I was excited. It was a new adventure. But my grandmother and my parents would appear in duller, cooler colors to reflect the thoughts of the adults who understood the whole situation. 
				</h2>
				<h2>
					As for the interactivity aspect of this project, I want to give viewers a choice. There are many times where I have said and done things that were not aligned with how I felt. I want to give them the choice to look at my feelings rather than just string them along for the ride. In certain scenarios, I want viewers to choose to respond as I had in the past and go through the scene, or choose to respond as I had felt and be shown visual elements of my emotions. For example, in arguments with my parents in my childhood, I often just let them vent, staying silent and giving them the answers they wanted. With the project, as tensions rise, I plan to have visual effects, things shaking and trembling like a heartbeat. If the viewers were to choose to follow how I would usually respond, the scene would pass. If the audience were to react according to my thoughts, the scene would change. Colors would shift, backgrounds may change colors, the people may change figures.
